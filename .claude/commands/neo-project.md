## Context
You have access to:
- The current architecture and design patterns (`AGENT.md`)
- The project description file (`PROJECT_IDEA.md`)

## Steps

1. **Deep Analysis & Planning**  
   - Review `AGENT.md` and `PROJECT_IDEA.md` thoroughly.  
   - Draft a detailed implementation plan that integrates seamlessly into the existing codebase.  
   - Identify required file changes, dependencies, and potential refactoring steps.

2. Project **title and description**
   - Change the `[TITLE]` and `[DESCRIPTION]`
     -  `src/app/layout.tsx`
     -  `public/manifest.json`

3. **Build & Fix**  
   - Detect and resolve any errors or warnings until the build completes successfully.

4. **Version Control**  
   - Verify if a Git repository is already initialized in the project directory.  
   - Create a git repository using git cli (gh), if it is not created
   - At the end, if build is successful, commit changes
